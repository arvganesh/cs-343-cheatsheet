\section{Particle Filters}
When $|X|$ of variable is too large, it's hard to keep track of an explicit distribution $P(X)$.

Instead, use particles (samples) to approximate $P(X)$, $P(x)$ approximated by the \# of particles with value $x$.

\textbf{1. Elapse Time:} Change particle positions by sampling from transition distribution $P(X_t|X_{t-1})$.

\textbf{2. Observe Evidence (reweight particles)}: 
Reweight particles based on with weight $w(X) = P(e|X)$

\textbf{3. Resample} Resample $N$ particles with replacement according to their weights and repeat.
